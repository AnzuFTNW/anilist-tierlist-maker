# Planned Features / Ideas
- Allowing more customization of the tierlist itself e.g. color, amount of rows, tier-name
- Being able to create anime/manga tierlists instead of character tierlists
- Better way to save the images? (not sure if possible cuz of CORS thingy)
- Design (The current design is just temporarily)
- Allowing to save progress through accounts (maybe)
