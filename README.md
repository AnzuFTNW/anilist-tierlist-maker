# How To

- Select if you want to make a character or anime/manga tierlist
- Hover on the right with your mouse to reveal the card-pool and trash area
- Drag and drop every character you want that matched your search query to your tierlist
- Change the individual color and name of each row
- You may also add or remove additional rows

- Repeat

# Planned Features / Ideas

- Allowing to save progress through accounts (maybe)
- Allowing to save through a button (CORS problems)

- It's possible to mix animanga entrys and characters but I see no reason to remove this
